                    The need for blood affects us all. Eight out of ten people need blood or blood products at some time in our lives. One out of every ten patients in hospital requires blood transfusion. The number of blood donations that patients receive depends on their medical condition. Although an average of three donations is transfused to a patient, some patients require many more.

Blood is in constant demand for the treatment of patients involved in accidents, patients with anaemia, malaria, cancer or a bleeding disorder such as haemophilia. Many surgical operations would not be possible without the availability of blood. Blood may be needed during or following childbirth or for an exchange transfusion in newborn babies.

The need for blood never stops. Blood donors save lives. Every blood donation gives the person who receives it a new chance at life.

                    Donors should be between the ages of 18 and 65, weigh at least 50 kg and not have donated blood within the previous 12 weeks (for males). The criteria, which are applied before a person can be accepted as a blood donor, are very strict. Not everyone can be a blood donor. This is designed to protect the health of the donor as well as the health of the patient who receives the blood.

For example, people who have certain medical conditions or who are taking certain types of medication are not permitted to donate blood. People whose sexual behaviour places them at increased risk of transmitting infections through transfusion are also not permitted to donate. If any of the deferral criteria apply to you, or if for any reason you think that your blood may be unsafe to transfuse to a patient, you are advised not to donate.

The mission of the blood transfusion service is to provide all patients with sufficient, safe, quality blood and blood products. If you are in any doubt about whether you should donate blood, please discuss it with a staff member. We know it can be disappointing if you are not able to give blood. However, we hope you will understand that our overriding responsibility is to ensure the safety of donors and the safety of the blood for patients.

                    Blood is donated voluntarily, freely and without payment or reward of any kind. Blood must only be donated in the spirit of altruism for patients who need blood or blood products as part of their medical treatment. Blood is donated as an act of goodwill towards a fellow human being and nothing should be expected in return for giving this gift of life.

What you do get in return is a physical and emotional sense of well-being and the knowledge that you have helped to save someone's life. We all hope that someone will do the same for us when we need a blood transfusion.

                    The procedure, which is performed by a trained, skilled health-care professional, takes approximately 30 minutes. You will give about 450 ml of blood, after which you will be advised to remain on the donor bed for a few minutes longer and then to take some refreshments. Plan to spend about half an hour to an hour at the blood donor centre for the entire process, depending on the size of the centre and the number of donors.</div>

                    After donation, it's best to have a snack and drink plenty of fluids over the next four hours. You can then resume routine sporting or training activity. It is advisable not to donate blood three to four weeks before participating in a major sporting event such as a marathon, or a competitive rugby or football match, where you intend to push yourself to the limit of your ability.

In the unlikely event that you do feel faint, light-headed or unwell during any sporting activities, you should immediately stop the activity and rest. Many active sports people are regular blood donors.

People who frequently push themselves to their limit during their sporting activities should consider donating only platelets. In this situation the red blood cells are returned to the donor after the donation and the individual's oxygen-carrying capacity and performance are not compromised.</div>

                    Firstly, you will be asked to provide personal details such as your name, address, age, weight, ID number and/or date of birth. A medical history is taken by means of a written questionnaire.

These questions are designed to ascertain that it is medically safe for you to donate blood and that the recipient of your blood will not be harmed in any way. In addition, very personal questions relating to your mode of life and sexual behaviour are asked to ascertain that you are not at increased risk of potentially transmitting infection through transfusion. People are asked to exclude themselves from blood donation if any of the deferral criteria apply to them.

A finger prick test is performed in order to ascertain if your haemoglobin level is within a safe range for donation purposes. Potential donors will be permitted to donate only if this measurement is within the defined, acceptable range. If everything is in order you will proceed to donate your blood.                    </div>
